Pretty basic idea. I want to create a set of classes and functions for creating card games in Swift. 

Going to continue building out logic for controlling the flow of cards, and eventually I am planning on create a set of games that a user can play.

Feel free to use this code however you'd like. I plan on taking these functions and building out a set of card games.
